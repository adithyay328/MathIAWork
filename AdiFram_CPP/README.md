# AdiFram_CPP
An opinionated, simple framework for C++ that I developed for personal use, but am cool with sharing with others. 

I'm developing this framework as I go, adding features and libraries I feel are important as they become relevant to my applications. While performance is important, I value productivity more; as such, some of the abstractions I use in this framework may compromise runtime performance in exchange for ease of use.
